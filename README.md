# Project Overview

In the [Custom Enumberables project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/custom-enumerables), various enumerable methods are recreated without the use of Ruby's Enumerables mixin methods.

One goal of these assignments is to get comfortable using `yield` as well as playing with procs and blocks. 

A script prints out the recreated methods alongside the original Ruby methods to test their return values.
